def create_dataloader(dataset:torch.utils.data.Dataset, **dataloader_kwargs):
    r"""
        Data loader. Combines a dataset and a sampler, and provides an iterable over
        the given dataset.

        The :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` supports both map-style and
        iterable-style datasets with single- or multi-process loading, customizing
        loading order and optional automatic batching (collation) and memory pinning.

        See :py:mod:`torch.utils.data` documentation page for more details.

        Args:
            dataset (Dataset): dataset from which to load the data.
            batch_size (int, optional): how many samples per batch to load
                (default: ``1``).
            shuffle (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to have the data reshuffled
                at every epoch (default: ``False``).
            sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): defines the strategy to draw
                samples from the dataset. Can be any ``Iterable`` with ``__len__``
                implemented. If specified, :attr:`shuffle` must not be specified.
            batch_sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): like :attr:`sampler`, but
                returns a batch of indices at a time. Mutually exclusive with
                :attr:`batch_size`, :attr:`shuffle`, :attr:`sampler`,
                and :attr:`drop_last`.
            num_workers (int, optional): how many subprocesses to use for data
                loading. ``0`` means that the data will be loaded in the main process.
                (default: ``0``)
            collate_fn (callable, optional): merges a list of samples to form a
                mini-batch of Tensor(s).  Used when using batched loading from a
                map-style dataset.
            pin_memory (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will copy Tensors
                into CUDA pinned memory before returning them.  If your data elements
                are a custom type, or your :attr:`collate_fn` returns a batch that is a custom type,
                see the example below.
            drop_last (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete batch,
                if the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If ``False`` and
                the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size, then the last batch
                will be smaller. (default: ``False``)
            timeout (numeric, optional): if positive, the timeout value for collecting a batch
                from workers. Should always be non-negative. (default: ``0``)
            worker_init_fn (callable, optional): If not ``None``, this will be called on each
                worker subprocess with the worker id (an int in ``[0, num_workers - 1]``) as
                input, after seeding and before data loading. (default: ``None``)
            generator (torch.Generator, optional): If not ``None``, this RNG will be used
                by RandomSampler to generate random indexes and multiprocessing to generate
                `base_seed` for workers. (default: ``None``)
            prefetch_factor (int, optional, keyword-only arg): Number of samples loaded
                in advance by each worker. ``2`` means there will be a total of
                2 * num_workers samples prefetched across all workers. (default: ``2``)
            persistent_workers (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will not shutdown
                the worker processes after a dataset has been consumed once. This allows to
                maintain the workers `Dataset` instances alive. (default: ``False``)
